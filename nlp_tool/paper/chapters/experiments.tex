\section{Experimental Setup}

The experimental setup for this study involves using as initial first data set for pattern analysis and rule creation. Using the first data set, our goal was to
create an algorithm that brings a drug's name as close to a Filipino nativization as possible. After creating the algorithm, we then bring in more data sets and
test the algorithm there.
