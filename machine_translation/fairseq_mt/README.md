# `zrygan/nlp/machine_translation`

Machine translating one source language to a target language using the Seq-to-Seq toolkit [fairseq](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq).

This program requires `uv` to run a fast python package and project manager, 

To run the model, use perform `pip install uv`. Then, change virtual env: `source .venv/bin/activate`.

Any actions about module installations and running python files, run `uv` such as:
`uv run --active python -c "import fai"`.

To download the latest packages, perform `uv sync`.

## Usage

Make sure to activate the virtual directory first.

First, preprocess all the verses data from `bible_cleaning/parallel_corpus/by_verses` to unigram.

Go to `/scripts` or perform `cd ./scripts`. Assuming that you are executing in that folder, execute:

```bash
uv run --active python training_data_creation.py
```

Then, convert raw data to unigram format.

Change directory to `/unigram_preprocess` or do `cd ./unigram_preprocess` and execute the following lines of code:

```bash
./unigram_conversion
```

Make sure that it has permissions, if not, perform `chmod 777 <filename>` in the same directory. Executing this setups the folders and files to run three python files for unigram generation, encoding, and fairseq preprocessing.

> NOTE: you can configure the SRC and DST language. Default as of moment is tagalog and cebuano.
> Change the settings for which unigram via unigram.bash file
> SRC_LANG="ceb"
> TGT_LANG="tgl

Afterwards, you can start training. Make sure you have the right uv modules for training.

Change directory to `/train`, and choose a machine translation method to train.

> NOTE: if you want to configure a new format, save the previous version training bash script and the evaulation results in `fairseq_mt/evaluation/<user_defined_mt_name>`

SRC --> DST: `./train-src-dest.bash`

SRC --> PIVOT --> DST: `./train-src-pivot-dest.bash`

While 10 minutes while training.

Afterwards, it should produce a checkpoint at `/results`.

Change directoru to the previos parent and perform evaluation.
