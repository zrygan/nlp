Machine translating one source language to a target language using the Seq-to-Seq toolkit [fairseq](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq).

This program requires `uv` to run a fast python package and project manager, 

To run the model, use perform `pip install uv`. Then, change virtual env: `source .venv/bin/activate`.

Any actions about module installations and running python files, run `uv` such as:
`uv run --active python -c "import fai"`.

To download the latest packages, perform `uv sync`.

## Usage

Make sure to activate the virtual directory first.

First, preprocess all the verses data from `bible_cleaning/parallel_corpus/by_verses` to unigram.

Go to `./scripts` or perform `cd ./scripts`. Assuming that you are executing in that folder, execute:

```bash
uv run --active python ./training_data_creation.py
```

Then, Go to `./unigram_preprocess` and execute the following lines of code:

```bash
uv run --active python unigram_convert_vocab.py
```
