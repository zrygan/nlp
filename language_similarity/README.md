## Corpora Specifications

The corpora used in this project is the one generated by the 
[`bible_cleaning` project](/bible_cleaning/README.md#corpora-specifications)

The corpora covers the following regions of the Philippines:

| Language | ISO 639 | Primary Regions (ADM1) |
|-----------|----------|------------------------|
| Tagalog | tgl | NCR, IV-A, IV-B, III |
| Cebuano | ceb | VII, X, XI, XIII |
| Ilocano | ilo | I, II, CAR |
| Hiligaynon | hil | VI, XII |
| Bikol | bik (bcl) | V |
| Waray-Waray | war | VIII |
| Kapampangan | pam | III |
| Pangasinan | pag | I (Pangasinan area) |
| Adasen | tiu | II, CAR (northeastern Abra and western Apayao) |
| Chavacano | cbk | IX, BARMM |
| Paranan | prf | II |
| Tausug | tsg | BARMM |
| Romblomanon | rol | IV-B |
| Masbatenyo | msb | V |
| Kinaray-a | krj | VI |

## Socio-Geographical Determinants

**Motivation** Historically, the smallest socio-political unit of Philippine society was the barangay, whose pre-colonial location was often determined by proximity to water — rivers, coasts, and estuaries.
Given the archipelagic and mountainous nature of the Philippines, settlement distribution may have constrained inter-barangay communication, influencing the evolution and divergence of local languages.

**Hypothesis** The linguistic diversity of the Philippines stems from geographical isolation and limited inter-community interaction, driven by:
- The archipelagic structure, which restricts cross-island contact.
- The mountainous interior, which separates fertile, riverine, or coastal regions.
- The natural distance between habitable zones, reducing opportunities for linguistic convergence.

Following colonization, the establishment of Church-centered towns may have altered these dynamics, increasing interaction and thereby promoting partial linguistic homogenization.

**Goals and Questions**
1. Quantify lexical or phonological similarity as a function of spatial separation.<br> 
**(RQ 1)** To what extent does geographical distance correlate with linguistic similarity among Philippine languages?
1. Examine whether terrain features predict language group boundaries.<br> 
**(RQ 2)** How do physical barriers (mountain ranges, waterways, island boundaries) influence the clustering of languages or dialects?
1. Compare pre-colonial vs. colonial spatial models to see shifts in language clustering. <br>
**(RQ 3)** Do pre-colonial settlement patterns (riverine and coastal barangays) correspond more closely with linguistic similarity than colonial-era, Church-centered town distributions?
1. Control for sociopolitical and demographic variables. <br>
**(RQ 4)** Which factor better explains linguistic variation — geographic isolation, population density, or colonial administrative influence?
