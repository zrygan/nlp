Computing the similarity of languages.

## Socio-Geographical Determinants

**Motivation** Historically, the smallest socio-political unit of Philippine society was the barangay, whose pre-colonial location was often determined by proximity to water — rivers, coasts, and estuaries.
Given the archipelagic and mountainous nature of the Philippines, settlement distribution may have constrained inter-barangay communication, influencing the evolution and divergence of local languages.

**Hypothesis** The linguistic diversity of the Philippines stems from geographical isolation and limited inter-community interaction, driven by:
- The archipelagic structure, which restricts cross-island contact.
- The mountainous interior, which separates fertile, riverine, or coastal regions.
- The natural distance between habitable zones, reducing opportunities for linguistic convergence.

Following colonization, the establishment of Church-centered towns may have altered these dynamics, increasing interaction and thereby promoting partial linguistic homogenization.

**Goals and Questions**
1. Quantify lexical or phonological similarity as a function of spatial separation.<br> 
**(RQ 1)** To what extent does geographical distance correlate with linguistic similarity among Philippine languages?
1. Examine whether terrain features predict language group boundaries.<br> 
**(RQ 2)** How do physical barriers (mountain ranges, waterways, island boundaries) influence the clustering of languages or dialects?
1. Compare pre-colonial vs. colonial spatial models to see shifts in language clustering. <br>
**(RQ 3)** Do pre-colonial settlement patterns (riverine and coastal barangays) correspond more closely with linguistic similarity than colonial-era, Church-centered town distributions?
1. Control for sociopolitical and demographic variables. <br>
**(RQ 4)** Which factor better explains linguistic variation — geographic isolation, population density, or colonial administrative influence?
